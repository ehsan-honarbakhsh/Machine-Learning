This project involves applying multiple data mining techniques across three different tasks: classification, regression, and natural language processing (NLP).
It covers all stages of the data science pipelineâ€”from data understanding and preparation to model training and evaluation.

A wide range of algorithms have been implemented, each chosen with clear justification and accompanied by detailed explanations. Every stage of the pipeline is thoroughly documented, including hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation.

The datasets used for each task are included, and the complete code with step-by-step explanations is available in a Python notebook.
